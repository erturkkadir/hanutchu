# AI Speech Interactive Web Application

An interactive web application that enables real-time speech recognition and AI-powered responses, creating a seamless voice-based interaction between users and AI.

## 🌟 Features

- Real-time speech recognition using whisper.cpp
- Natural language processing with AI model integration
- Voice synthesis for AI responses (Kokoro/ F5 TTS)
- Responsive web design for all devices
- Low-latency communication
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/erturkkadir/hanutchu.git
cd hanutchu
```



## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: vanilla js 
- **Speech Recognition**: whisper.cpp
- **Voice Synthesis**: vioce activity detection
- **AI Integration**: ollama with any model
- **Styling**: Bootstrap CSS
- **Development**: Python. Websokcet/WebRTC, 

## 🔧 System Requirements

- Modern web browser with microphone and.or webcam
- Active internet connection


## 📖 How It Works

1. **Speech Recognition**: The application listens to user speech input using basic browser functions
2. **Text Processing**: Converts speech to text and processes it for AI model consumption
3. **AI Processing**: Sends processed text to AI model and receives response
4. **Voice Synthesis**: Converts AI response to speech using S2T model (kokoro, F5)
5. **User Interface**: Updates UI with transcription and response in real-time
